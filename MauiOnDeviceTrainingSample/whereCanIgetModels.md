✅ 1. TensorFlow Hub (TF‑Hub) – Official Source
Many models can be downloaded directly as .tflite or converted from SavedModel.
🔗 https://tfhub.dev
Look for models tagged "TFLite" or "mobile" (e.g., image classification, object detection, pose estimation).

✅ 2. TensorFlow Lite Model Zoo (official GitHub)
Google maintains a set of example apps + pre‑trained .tflite files.
🔗 https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tensorflow_lite
You’ll find models for:

Image classification (MobileNet, EfficientNet)
Object detection (SSD, YOLO variants)
Segmentation
Keyword spotting
Pose estimation (MoveNet)


✅ 3. TensorFlow Examples Repo
Contains ready-to-download .tflite models used in example apps.
🔗 https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/models

✅ 4. MediaPipe Models (Google ML Kit compatible)
MediaPipe provides high-quality .tflite models for:

Face detection / face mesh
Hand tracking
Pose tracking
Object detection
Selfie segmentation

✅ 5. ML Kit (Android/iOS)
Google ML Kit provides models that can be downloaded and used as .tflite.
🔗 https://developers.google.com/ml-kit

✅ 6. Community Sources
These often contain extra models or optimized versions:

HuggingFace has community-optimized .tflite models
